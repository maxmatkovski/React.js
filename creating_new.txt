If you get this error: ""npm ERR! missing script: start"  when trying to run. 

You might have a old global install of npm that's causing a problem. As of 12/19 npm does not support global installs.

Uninstall the package using:
npm uninstall -g create-react-app 

Some osx/Linux users may need to go a bit further to remove the old npm. Do so with this command:
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/create-react-app

This is now the only supported method for generating a project:
npx create-react-app my-app 

With that done cd and start it:
cd my-app
npm start
